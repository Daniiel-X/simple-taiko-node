# Simple Taiko Node

This guide is the same [guide](https://docs.taiko.xyz/guides/run-a-taiko-node) provided in our website. You can use both.

# Run a Taiko Node

This guide will help you start up a Taiko RPC node using simple-taiko-node.

>**Note:** For now, you can run a **plain RPC node** which is mainly useful for fun / development purposes. There is some information below on starting an SGX / ZK-EVM prover, but the docs are a work in progress ðŸš§. Stay tuned for updates!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/): Installed and running.
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git/): Installed.
- For Windows users: Install [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) as your terminal. 

Meet the [Geth minimum hardware requirements](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum#hardware-requirements), except for the storage requirement, as Taiko nodes require less storage.

## Run a Taiko Node

1. **Clone simple-taiko-node:**

    Mac/Linux:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node.git
    cd simple-taiko-node
    ```

    Windows:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node.git
    cd simple-taiko-node && git config core.autocrlf false
    ```

2. **Copy the sample .env files:**

    ```bash
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```

3. **Set the L1 archive node endpoint:**

    Open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor:

    Mac/Linux:

    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```

    Windows:

    ```bash
    notepad .env
    ```

    Next, you will set the L1 archive node endpoints.

    > **Note:** You can use any Holesky L1 endpoint, but it must point to an archive node to access the state trie beyond the last 128 blocks.
    > Itâ€™s recommended to [run a local Holesky node](https://docs.taiko.xyz/guides/run-a-holesky-node), but you can explore other [Holesky RPC providers](https://chainlist.org/chain/17000). Keep in mind they will **eventually rate limit your node**, and it will stop syncing, so a local L1 node is recommended for a proper setup.

    If you are running a local Holesky node, you cannot reference the L1 endpoints as `http://127.0.0.1:8545` and `ws://127.0.0.1:8546` because that is local to inside the simple-taiko-node Docker image. Depending on your firewall setup, you can do a few things. You can try:

    - Using `host.docker.internal` (see: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48546124/how-to-access-host-port-from-docker-container-using-ip-address))
    - Using the private IP address of your machine (use something like `ip addr show` to get this IP address)

    After getting the address of the Holesky archive node, set the following L1 node endpoints in your `.env` file:

    - `L1_ENDPOINT_HTTP`
    - `L1_ENDPOINT_WS`

    Take a look at the comments above these values in the `.env.sample` to see how to set them up.


4. **Start the node:**

    > **Note:** If you ran a testnet node previously, run `docker compose down -v` to remove old volumes.

    Ensure Docker is running, then execute the following command to start the node:

        docker compose up -d


## Verify Node is Running

**Option 1: Check with the node dashboard**

A node dashboard will be running on `localhost` on the `GRAFANA_PORT` you set in your `.env` file, which defaults to `3001`: [http://localhost:3001/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview](http://localhost:3001/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview).

You can verify that your node is syncing by checking that the **chain head** on the dashboard is increasing. Once the chain head matches whatâ€™s on the block explorer, you are fully synced.

**Option 2: Check with curl commands**

1. Check if the Execution Layer client is connected to Taiko L2:

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8547 \
      -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{"method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
    ```

    Verify the chainId response is `0x28c60` (167008):

   `{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "result": "0x28c60" }`

2. Check if the Execution Layer client is synced by requesting the latest Taiko L2 / L3 block from the Execution Layer client:

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8547 \
      -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{"method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
    ```

3. If the blockNumber response value is `0` or not growing, check the Taiko L2 logs here:

    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f
    ```

> **Note:** You may need to use `sudo docker compose logs -f` if you are not in the `docker` group.

### Video Tutorial

See the video tutorial [Run a Taiko L2 node (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_tVvDcuK5o). Itâ€™s for a previous testnet but the overall steps are the same!

## Enable a Proposer

To enable a proposer, follow these steps:

1. First, you will need to have a prover from the marketplace. This prover must be able to generate SGX and ZK-EVM proofs (for now, but will later plan to de-couple these proof markets). This is because itâ€™s unknown at the time of block proposal if the prover which provides the bond will need to generate an SGX or ZK proof. See the current tier configuration [here](https://docs.taiko.xyz/network-reference/network-configuration).
2. Then you can set `PROVER_ENDPOINTS` in simple-taiko-node `.env` file to the proverâ€™s endpoint.
3. Next, set the `L1_PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY` to an L1 accountâ€™s private key which will send the Propose Block transactions.
4. Finally set `ENABLE_PROPOSER` to true in simple-taiko-node `.env`.

## Enable an SGX Prover

1. Follow the guide here:
    - Raiko docker tutorial: [https://github.com/johntaiko/zeth/blob/feat/taiko/README_Docker.md](https://github.com/johntaiko/zeth/blob/feat/taiko/README_Docker.md)
    - See docker compose config here: [https://github.com/johntaiko/zeth/blob/feat/taiko/docker/docker-compose-pos.yml](https://github.com/johntaiko/zeth/blob/feat/taiko/docker/docker-compose-pos.yml)
    - Note: Running docker with `--init` will do the bootstrap: [https://github.com/johntaiko/zeth/blob/feat/taiko/docker/entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/johntaiko/zeth/blob/feat/taiko/docker/entrypoint.sh)
2. Submit your public key to the form: [https://forms.gle/qquRq3cnGbyneV9S6](https://forms.gle/qquRq3cnGbyneV9S6). 

    **Please do not spam submit to this form**. We do not expect too many folks to have SGX provers and thatâ€™s okay! Only submit after you have generated your key pair with your SGX machine. After submitting we will manually register the public key and send you the necessary TTKOk.

## Enable a ZK-EVM Prover

-  Check the `.env` in **simple-taiko-node** and edit variables accordingly to start a prover.
